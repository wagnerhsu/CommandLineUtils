I'm glad you're about to open a PR. Just a few tips before you click submit:

* Feel free to add a note to the CHANGELOG.md file and/or the releasenotes.props file. I'd like to give you credit for your work.
* Please make sure you read, or at least skimmed, CONTRIBUTING.md
* I may not take PRs if they come out of the blue and make big changes. 
  If you're not sure if something is a "big change", please open an issue first.
  
Thanks!
